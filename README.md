# M250-sudoku

<h3>Collaboration of M250 students</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Joel Peyton</li>
    <li>Friends at the OU</li>
  </ul>
  
<h3>GUIDELINES</h3>
<p>For those interested in collaborating please take time to read these short guidelines</p>
<ol>
  <li>This may well be a case of the blind leading the blind, so please don't be afraid to speak up if you think we can do things better.</li>
  <li>That said, let's try and keep to the orginal design style and colours, unless there is a real concensus that the original is shockingly bad.</li>
  <li>Let's try and keep to a coding convention, indents 4 spaces, whitespace, comments if needed, etc.  Take a look at the original files if you're not sure.</li>
  <li>Check out the issues tab, these are tasks that need doing.  I'll keep them small so that they are achievable.</li>
  <li>If your interested in the task, say so in the comments and I'll allocate them accordingly so that we aren't repeating work.</li>
  <li>If you need to, create issues, we can then discuss and allocate them accordingly.</li>
  <li>If you can't do an allocated task, ask for help or ask to be allocated another.</li>
  <li>And finally, I setup this project up to help with understanding github and working with others. We are all learning, so let's help each other out where possible.</li>  
</ol>

<h3>OBJECTIVE / DESIGN LAYOUT</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Utilise original files to make a workable playable puzzle</li>
  <li>Vertical menu that contains game functionality</li>
  <li>Horizontal menu with numbers 1 through 9 that are used to populate board</li>
  <li>Upon completion, look at and discuss a java app</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>NOTE&nbsp;</strong>Think we will need to work on design layout of the game initially , ie HTML/CSS before we can start working on the functionality, therefore I have only created these issues to deal.</p>
